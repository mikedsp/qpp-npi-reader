# qpp-npi-reader
Python programs to read and then analyze QPP Participation Status for a list of NPI numbers

The program, NPI Reader - 11.ipynb, is a python-based Jupyter Notebook that given a list of National Provider Identifiers (NPIs), extracts each providerâ€™s QPP Participation Status from the QPP Participation Status web site and puts the information into a .csv file. 

See the file, qpp-npi-reader.docx, for details on how to use the program

The file, 2022 and 2023 QPP Data Analysis.pdf, contains an analysis of 11,427 National Provider Identifiers extracted from the QPP Participation Status web site on May 31, 2024 for years 2022 and 2023. 

The program, qpp-npi-analyzer.ipynb, is a python-based Jupyter Notebook that, given an NPI QPP extract file created from the program, NPI Reader - 11.ipynb, produces an analysis of the extracted data. The analysis performed is the same information as found in the document, 2022 and 2023 QPP Data Analysis.pdf.
